## Project Structure
Most of the project(operations) has been based on Etzion & Niblett (2011) as pointed out in the [Acknowledgment](https://github.com/RxCEP/cepjs#acknowledgment) section of the main readme file. The reason for this was not only because it offers a complete guide around event processing, but also it has a rich set of patterns (a key topic for CEP existence) and includes a model where the inner workings of an event processing engine is modeled as an event processing network. This model, in turn, represents each operation as an event processing agent, where a set of those agents are connected forming a direct graph from event producers to consumers (see figure bellow). This way of representing an event processing engine maps nicely to the dataflow/functional style used in RxJS (first reactive library used in the project and the one that influenced the current syntax of CEP.js).

Currently the project is divided in three packages, all managed with the help of [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) package. One of the advantages of lerna is that it bootstraps (so it calls) dependencies among the managed subpackages. This means that it analyses the packages and install the common dependencies on the root of the project, avoid duplication of dependencies among the subpackages. To run the bootstrap operation, just execute the script `npm run bootstrap` on the root of the project.

The packages cepjs-most and cepjs-rx represent the current supported reactive libraries as noted on the [reactive-libraries](https://github.com/RxCEP/cepjs/blob/master/REACTIVE-LIBRARIES.md) file. Those packages gathers the reactive libraries with all the needed dependencies. The [cepjs-core](https://github.com/RxCEP/cepjs/tree/master/packages/cepjs-core) is the most important package of CEP.js since it concentrates the core functionalities. The current structure of cepjs-core is the following:

Every folder containing specifically the operations coded with the supported reactive libraries has inside an adapter folder. This folder indicates the portion of code that depends on the passed reactive library (the adaptee) to contruct the operations, hence the adapter. In fact, the project currently exploits three main design patterns: Adapter (to adapt the operations according to the supplied reactive library), Dependency Injection (reactive libraries are expected to be passed as dependencies), and Function Factory (every import on the core package returns a function factory that expects one of the supported reactive packages).

## Commit Guidelines
Before committing to the source, try to use the following conventions:

- http://karma-runner.github.io/6.1/dev/git-commit-msg.html
- https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716

The first link includes some arguments about why the use of those conventions.

Additionally, attempt not to commit directly to the master branch unless you are 100% sure your change won't add any bug/problem. Instead, prefer to follow a feature-branch schema.
